# JavaScript Methods Examples

This repository contains examples and explanations of various JavaScript methods categorized into different folders based on their functionality. It serves as a reference guide for understanding and learning JavaScript methods.

I created this repository for personal reference, and I hope it also serves as a helpful resource for others who want to understand JS methods.

## Usage

Each folder contains JavaScript files with examples of methods related to the respective category. Additionally, there are corresponding test files for each category to ensure the correctness of the examples.

To run the tests, we can use a testing framework like Jest. Make sure to have Node.js and NPM installed, then run:

```bash
npm install       # Install dependencies
npm test          # Run tests
```
